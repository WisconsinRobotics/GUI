# Rover GUI

The deprecated version of the GUI (With flask and vanilla JS) is in `./OldVersion`
The current version is `./frontend` (React) and `./backend` (Node)

---

# 📝 Description

The GUI is divided into 4 resizeable panels. The Control Panel, the Console Panel, the Camera Panel, and the Map Panel.

* **Control Panel**: Displays data obtained through ROS such as heading and position.
* **Console Panel**: Connects to the local console and the Jetson's console.
* **Camera Panel**: Stream videos by drawing frames on canvases. The frames are sent from the backend through websocket. The backend receives frames from the pi through UDP.
* **Map Panel**: Utilizes pre downloaded chunks. Refer to the README in the `frontend/src` folder for more information.

### 👥 Contacts
* Refer to **Joseph** for any issues with the video streaming
* Refer to **Aditya** for any issues with the map

## 🔮 Future Improvements

1. More telemetry data through ROS
2. Emergency stop button and launch script
3. Pi Terminals

# 🛠️ To Start the GUI in 3 Easy Steps

The base station has a launch script that does all of this: `./startGUI.sh`
It also has a launchable app on the side bar that runs the shell file.

### 📥 Frontend
Located in `./frontend`
```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

### 🗄️ Backend
Located in `./backend`
```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

### 🛰️ To start ROS server
The GUI uses Roslib to connect to Rosbridge, which must be running for ROS to work. Have ros2 humble/jazzy installed, install `rosbridge_server` package, and run:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml
```
*💡 Running the server with `"delay_between_messages:=0.0"` could fix a version error.*

#### 🧪 Testing the OpenCV Video streaming
* Install libraries and run `streamProducer.py` in `./OldVersion/src/`
* Change the input port to match video source in `index.js` if necessary.

# 📺 To start the (Deprecated) Webrtc signalling server for video streaming

1. Change the CameraPanel in the frontend to the gstreamer version.
2. Build `gst-plugins-rs` and source with:
   ```bash
   export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=[path to gst-plugins-rs]/target/debug:\$GST_PLUGIN_PATH
   ```
3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin gst-webrtc-signalling-server
   ```
4. The streamer would run something like this, which would go through the server and then to the GUI:
   ```bash
   gst-launch-1.0 webrtcsink name=ws meta="meta,name=gst-stream" signaller::uri="ws://10.141.81.176:8443" mfvideosrc ! videoconvert ! vp8enc deadline=1 ! queue ! video/x-vp8 ! ws.
   ```

*⚠️ May have to set port 5000, 9090 inbound to open in firewall for multiple client.*

*📌 The `ros.js` file is publishing and then subscribing to the ros websocket to simulate actual input.*

# 🔄 To start the Old GUI from ./OldVersion

```bash
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run `app.py` in `wr_hci_hud/src`

## 📜 History

Ideas for this node have gone through several iterations. None of the following have been implemented far enough to have a good estimate for the efficacy of the method:

### 🌐 Option 1: A locally hosted webserver on the base station (probably easiest in Python)
This options live-updates its components to reflect subscriptions over ROS.

* **Pros:**
  * Most of the GUI heavy-lifting is taken care of by the web browser
  * Lots of options/documentation for the web server itself
  * Could be accessed/used by any other computer on the network (good for debugging)
* **Cons:**
  * May be hidden complexity to configure layout
  * Transporting images/geospatial data (if rendered) may take up a lot of bandwidth
  * Rendering geospatial data/proprioception might not be easy
  * Camera streaming might not be possible due to bandwidth, may still need extra tool
  * Lack of Internet at competition might limit design or force pre-downloaded dependencies

### 🖥️ Option 2: Qt/Tk/similar locally hosted application that is ROS-aware
* **Pros:**
  * Lots of language options
  * Broad customizability
  * Likely easier ROS integration (due to customizability)
  * Easier to make visual rendering more efficient
* **Cons:**
  * Analysis Paralysis
    * The team does more of the legwork on the GUI magic
    * Likely complex configuration
  * Constrained to platform compiled for, or need to distribute the binary

### ⌨️ Option 3: Direct console access (current solution)
* **Pros:**
  * Few/no layers of extra support required between operator and WRover
  * No GUI work
* **Cons:**
  * Operator must be ***extremely*** proficient in ROS/`bash`/filesystems/networks
    * No assistance/recovery available if something goes wrong
  * Hard to visualize large number of subsystems at once
  * Slow to operate
  * Hard to construct complex diagnostic tools and insights on the fly
  * Little to no visual support outside of `rqt`

> Given past experience at competition, even a small GUI with no input options (a literal HUD) would be massively beneficial compared to reading individaul diagnostics one at a time. This could then be expanded to provide more detailed insights, inputs to the WRover, and specializations for the different competition modes.
